As an admin/hr, I want to be able to add information about new employees to the Employee list so that other co-workers can see general information about new ones.

Scenario - Add information about new employees.

Given - The user navigated to the PIM page.
When - The user presses the button "+ Add".
And - The user navigates to the "Add Employee" form page.
Then - The user writes information into the fields.
When - The user presses the button "Save".
Then - The system adds a new employee to the "Employee List".
